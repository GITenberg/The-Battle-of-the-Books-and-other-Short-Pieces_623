description: "The Battle of the Books is the name of a short satire written by Jonathan\
  \ Swift and published as part of the prolegomena to his A Tale of a Tub in 1704.\
  \ It depicts a literal battle between books in the King's Library (housed in St.\
  \ James's Palace at the time of the writing), as ideas and authors struggle for\
  \ supremacy. Because of the satire, \"The Battle of the Books\" has become a term\
  \ for the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
